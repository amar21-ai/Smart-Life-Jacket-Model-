# ðŸ›Ÿ Smart Life Jacket â€“ Rescue Priority System

This project presents a **smart life jacket monitoring and rescue prioritization system**.  
By processing real-time telemetry from life jackets â€” such as heart rate, blood oxygen (SpOâ‚‚), humidity, sinking state, location, and communication metrics â€” the system predicts a **priority score (0â€“100)** for each user. This score helps rescuers allocate resources effectively during emergency operations.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Ensures valid, consistent telemetry for model input.  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Regressor trained to predict rescue priority.  
- **Flask API**: Serves the trained model for real-time scoring.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes users, priority scores, and rescue paths.
